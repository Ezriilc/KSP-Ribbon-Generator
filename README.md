KSP-Ribbon-Generator
====================

Ribbons are awards you give yourself for accomplishing feats of daring in Kerbal Space Program, using images created by Unistrut. Things like getting into orbit and landing on another planet - ya know, all in a day's work. The Ribbon Generator lets you choose which goals you've done, and combine them into a fancy image that you can put in your signature, or wherever you like.
